# Changelog

## Clock Timeselection
We chose to use a clock similar to Google Calendar for time selection as opposed to the previously designed dropdown menu.
This change was made to make the design looks nice.

## Schedule Duration display clock
For clarity, we added a clock that displays the start and end time of the user visually.

## Font
Font sizes were slightly adapted to be easier to read for users.
