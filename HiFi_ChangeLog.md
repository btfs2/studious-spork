# Changelog

## Clock Timeselection
We chose to use a clock similar to Google Calendar for time selection as opposed to the previously designed dropdown menu.
This change was made to make the design looks nice.

## Schedule Duration display clock
For clarity, we added a clock that displays the start and end time of the user visually.

## Font
Font sizes were slightly adapted to be easier to read for users.

## Functionality
Location search is quite slow because our API is slow. We did not focus on finding a faster one or optimizing the 
caching as the focus of this project is interaction design rather than backend.
