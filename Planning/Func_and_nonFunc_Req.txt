Functional: The app needs to
- use a weather API to be able to provide accurate weather data for different countries,
- allow users to enter their schedule for the day as a variable number of [time | location] pairs and
- slice weather forecasts from these locations together based on this schedule and
- provide a summary as well as individual forecasts. It also should
- remember the schedule entered/used in the last session to make future interactions quicker if the same schedule is to be used

Non-functional:
- Users need to get their results quickly
- Interaction needs to be easy and intuitive for all age groups and genders
