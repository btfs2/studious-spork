#Interview with Austrian Sales & Marketing Person working at a company that organizes conferences

Q: How does your average day look like?
A: I have a strict morning routine although work hours and locations are flexible and vary greatly.
My work day usually starts with e-mails and phone calls. Whenever I plan to call someone,
I like to do it early in the day - before they have other meetings. On some days, I am in the office
for the majority of the day and handle internal stuff and work with the marketing people to develop
synergetic strategies. On many days, I am out meeting with potential sponsors and exhibitors to discuss
details of potential cooperations.

Q: Do you move around a lot during your day?
A: I drive to different locations in the city on most days. Sometimes I also need to drive to other
counties [the business is situated in Vienna, the capital of Austria] where we organize events or 
where certain partners may be based.

Q: Do you at all think about the weather on the days you move so much?
A: Of course, but I always have an umberella in my car's trunk because you never know.
Other than that, I often can't really prepare much.

Q: Do seasons make a difference with what you wear?
A: In winter and in summer it is quite obvious what to wear. In spring and autumn you sometimes want to
wear a coat and sometimes not. It is quite annoying if you have your coat on on a day with 23° or if you
don't on a day with 13°.

Q: Would an app giving a worst-case summary of the weather at all the places you will be at during the day be helpful for these times?
A: Definitely for the days where I move between cities. Currently, I would check the weather for both places
seperately. It would be cool if I could just get a summary for both places for the times I am at each of them.
