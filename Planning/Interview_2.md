It changes a lot depending on tenure, office, industry you specialize in and of course how much you are willing to travel.

From BA to EM, you should expect working in a city other than your office roughly half of the year. Every Monday you leave, every Thursday or Friday (depending on whether “Friday in the office” is commonplace where you get hired) you go back. Obviously there will be consultants work the whole year in a different place, while other consultants may work in their home office the whole time.

As you become more senior (AP, Partner, Director), you should expect more frequent, shorter trips. You may spend Monday in a city, Tuesday to Wednesday in another, then maybe get to stay in your home office Thursday and Friday. Then maybe next week you never travel.

Again, it depends on what industry you work on and what client base you build. I’ve seen directors who were able to never travel (except company events), as all their clients were in their hometowns and, even if they were multinational companies, more junior people would travel to the subsidiaries, while the directors themselves would stay in their hometown where the headquarters were.

EDIT: saw the additional questions about enjoying the places you visit. You do, but kind of in a different way than a tourist would. You don’t have time to spend the day sightseeing (unless you stay for the weekend), but you see places a tourist would not see. Restaurants where clients take you to dinner, family meals if you’re lucky enough, you get to work with locals and see how they think, what work looks like there, etc…

Also, in some offices, the policy allows to fly anywhere for the weekend instead of flying home (as long as the ticket is cheaper - but if you book early enough, pretty much everywhere is cheaper than a flexible corporate airfare for even a short flight), which means you can not only explore the country you visit, but also the neighboring ones.
