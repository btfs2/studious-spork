The primary stakeholders are professionals who have to travel around frequently to different locations within the same work-day. This includes realtors, bankers, salespeople and executives at large companies. For example, a consultant at McKinsey might have to travel between offices in London and Paris. This app helps them plan their day according to the weather at the different places they will visit in the course of 24 hours.

A secondary feature, that will be implemented if time permits, will help the users decide what to wear. Professionals typically have a limited number of clothing choices (either business casual or business formal) and cannot change their outfits throughout the day.

The secondary stakeholders are the clients, potential buyers and other professionals that the users interact with at the different locations. For instance, if a realtor turns up well-prepared for an open house, the potential buyers are more likely to purchase the house.

Tertiary stakeholders will be the employers of the professionals that use the app. A company gets higher returns if their employees are more productive and organized. These companies also have to purchase the app for their employees so they will have to make a significant financial commitment.

Facilitating stakeholders include us (the developers) and weather API providers (currently Dark Sky API).
