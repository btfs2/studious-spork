#Primary Stakeholder

Sales people, executives, real estate brokers, analysts and many other professionals having multiple client meetings
each day. These can be at different places around a city, in multiple cities or even in multiple countries.
To perform well and achieve their goals of high sales, it is crucial that these professionals are always perfectly
dressed. What must not be forgotten, however, is that their clothing must be suitable for all weather conditions they 
will be facing throughout the day as they often have no chance to change their outfit between meetings.
 
This target group is most often between the ages of 20 and 70, not specific to any gender, and exists in many cultures.
They primarily live in cities and are used to a stressful and fast-paced life. This implies that they will not spend
much time with our app and will rather just want very quick feedback to their query. Moreover, this means that we need
to provide a fast and efficient way for them to submit queries to the app.

Almost all of them are technologically versed. As 94% use a smartphone daily, we can expect them to know how to interact
with standard smartphone apps. While they will likely be able to understand
weather information such as wind speed and likelihood of rain, their limited busy schedules might 
not allow them time to derive conclusions from these values for multiple locations, which is why a broken down summary
could be preferred.
