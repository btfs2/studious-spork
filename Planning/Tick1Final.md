1. Our primary stakeholders are professionals based in sales, who travel frequently for work.

2. Sales people, executives, real estate brokers, analysts and many other professionals having multiple client meetings each day. These can be at different places around a city, in multiple cities or even in multiple countries. To perform well and achieve their goals of high sales, it is crucial that these professionals are always perfectly dressed. What must not be forgotten, however, is that their clothing must be suitable for all weather conditions they will be facing throughout the day as they often have no chance to change their outfit between meetings.

This target group is most often between the ages of 20 and 70, not specific to any gender, and exists in many cultures. They primarily live in cities and are used to a stressful and fast-paced life. This implies that they will not spend much time with our app and will rather just want very quick feedback to their query. Moreover, this means that we need to provide a fast and efficient way for them to submit queries to the app.

Almost all of them are technologically versed. As 94% use a smartphone daily, we can expect them to know how to interact with standard smartphone apps. While they will likely be able to understand weather information such as wind speed and likelihood of rain, their limited busy schedules might not allow them time to derive conclusions from these values for multiple locations, which is why a broken down summary could be preferred.

3. Our main methods of gathering data will be talking to examples of our primary stakeholder (so professionals who have to travel to meetings during their work day) and people who know how these people work - we have members of our group with this knowledge, and can also contact some people that we know. We will also do secondary research online, looking for articles about business travel, as well as finding out if it's likely that our app is likely to actually be used.

* __Secondary research__: Our data gathering revealed that considering what to wear is a "very real concern" for people travelling for business, and that this decision is based on the weather [^1]. Typical real estate agents arrange most of their appointments for the afternoon, but would usually have to travel to their office in the morning and may also go out at lunch time, without being able to go home in between [^5] [^6]. This means that our app would be helping to solve a real problem.
A study [^7] by Harvard Business School also found there is "a lot of travel and a lot of flights", including someone who took 105 flights in a year.
As the typical business professionals use a smartphone (for example, 94% of real estate agents use a smartphone daily [^2]), the app could be accessed and used by a large portion of our primary stakeholder.
Continuing to focus on salespeople (e.g. real estate agents and bankers), we found that the typical real estate agent is 54 and female [^3], while more than 3/4 of entry-level Wall Street bankers are male [^4]. This means that the app could have a wide audience for both men and women. However, according the the Office for National Statistics [^8], men take longer commutes and are more likely to work in a different region to where they live, which suggests that men are more likely to travel between areas with significantly different weather.

* __Primary research__: We interviewed a sales and marketing person, who works for a company based in Vienna, asking how their work day is structured and whether the weather app, along with the specific features we've considered, would benefit them. Their answers agreed mostly with the secondary research - their day begins in the office with emails and phone calls, and then, depending on the day, they may go out to meet potential sponsors and exhibitors. They also said that they often move around the city a lot, and sometimes drive to other neighbouring countries. They also said that they do think about the weather when they're travelling, but beyond carrying an umbrella, they can't prepare much, especially in autumn and spring, when the weather is not so predictable and consistent accross one day as it in summer or winter. They said that it would be "cool" to be able to see a summary of the weather for two places together on the days that they move between cities. Another interview told us that people with more junior positions tend to travel to a city and stay there for a few days before returning, while more senior positions take frequent but shorter trips. They also said that if they have a free weekend in the middle of a trip, some offices will pay for them to use that time to visit another city rather than flying home.
