Our primary stakeholders are professionals based in sales, who travel frequently for work.

__2__

Sales people, executives, real estate brokers, analysts and many other professionals having multiple client meetings each day. These can be at different places around a city, in multiple cities or even in multiple countries. To perform well and achieve their goals of high sales, it is crucial that these professionals are always perfectly dressed. What must not be forgotten, however, is that their clothing must be suitable for all weather conditions they will be facing throughout the day as they often have no chance to change their outfit between meetings.

This target group is most often between the ages of 20 and 70, not specific to any gender, and exists in many cultures. They primarily live in cities and are used to a stressful and fast-paced life. This implies that they will not spend much time with our app and will rather just want very quick feedback to their query. Moreover, this means that we need to provide a fast and efficient way for them to submit queries to the app.

Almost all of them are technologically versed. As 94% use a smartphone daily, we can expect them to know how to interact with standard smartphone apps. While they will likely be able to understand weather information such as wind speed and likelihood of rain, their limited busy schedules might not allow them time to derive conclusions from these values for multiple locations, which is why a broken down summary could be preferred.

The primary stakeholders are professionals who have to travel around frequently to different locations within the same work-day. This includes realtors, bankers, salespeople and executives at large companies. For example, a consultant at McKinsey might have to travel between offices in London and Paris. This app helps them plan their day according to the weather at the different places they will visit in the course of 24 hours.

A secondary feature, that will be implemented if time permits, will help the users decide what to wear. Professionals typically have a limited number of clothing choices (either business casual or business formal) and cannot change their outfits throughout the day.

The secondary stakeholders are the clients, potential buyers and other professionals that the users interact with at the different locations. For instance, if a realtor turns up well-prepared for an open house, the potential buyers are more likely to purchase the house.

Tertiary stakeholders will be the employers of the professionals that use the app. A company gets higher returns if their employees are more productive and organized. These companies also have to purchase the app for their employees so they will have to make a significant financial commitment.

Facilitating stakeholders include us (the developers) and weather API providers (currently Dark Sky API).

Our main methods of gathering data will be talking to examples of our primary stakeholder (so professionals who have to travel to meetings during their work day) and people who know how these people work - we have members of our group with this knowledge, and can also contact some people that we know. We will also do secondary research online, looking for articles about business travel, as well as finding out if it's likely that our app is likely to actually be used.

* __Secondary research__: Our data gathering revealed that considering what to wear is a "very real concern" for people travelling for business, and that this decision is based on the weather [^1]. Typical real estate agents arrange most of their appointments for the afternoon, but would usually have to travel to their office in the morning and may also go out at lunch time, without being able to go home in between [^5] [^6]. This means that our app would be helping to solve a real problem.
A study [^7] by Harvard Business School also found there is "a lot of travel and a lot of flights", including someone who took 105 flights in a year.
As the typical business professionals use a smartphone (for example, 94% of real estate agents use a smartphone daily [^2]), the app could be accessed and used by a large portion of our primary stakeholder.
Continuing to focus on salespeople (e.g. real estate agents and bankers), we found that the typical real estate agent is 54 and female [^3], while more than 3/4 of entry-level Wall Street bankers are male [^4]. This means that the app could have a wide audience for both men and women. However, according the the Office for National Statistics [^8], men take longer commutes and are more likely to work in a different region to where they live, which suggests that men are more likely to travel between areas with significantly different weather.

* __Primary research__: We interviewed a sales and marketing person, who works for a company based in Vienna, asking how their work day is structured and whether the weather app, along with the specific features we've considered, would benefit them. Their answers agreed mostly with the secondary research - their day begins in the office with emails and phone calls, and then, depending on the day, they may go out to meet potential sponsors and exhibitors. They also said that they often move around the city a lot, and sometimes drive to other neighbouring countries. They also said that they do think about the weather when they're travelling, but beyond carrying an umbrella, they can't prepare much, especially in autumn and spring, when the weather is not so predictable and consistent accross one day as it in summer or winter. They said that it would be "cool" to be able to see a summary of the weather for two places together on the days that they move between cities. Another interview told us that people with more junior positions tend to travel to a city and stay there for a few days before returning, while more senior positions take frequent but shorter trips. They also said that if they have a free weekend in the middle of a trip, some offices will pay for them to use that time to visit another city rather than flying home.

__Interview 1__

Interview with Austrian Sales & Marketing Person working at a company that organizes conferences

Q: How does your average day look like? A: I have a strict morning routine although work hours and locations are flexible and vary greatly. My work day usually starts with e-mails and phone calls. Whenever I plan to call someone, I like to do it early in the day - before they have other meetings. On some days, I am in the office for the majority of the day and handle internal stuff and work with the marketing people to develop synergetic strategies. On many days, I am out meeting with potential sponsors and exhibitors to discuss details of potential cooperations.

Q: Do you move around a lot during your day? A: I drive to different locations in the city on most days. Sometimes I also need to drive to other counties [the business is situated in Vienna, the capital of Austria] where we organize events or where certain partners may be based.

Q: Do you at all think about the weather on the days you move so much? A: Of course, but I always have an umberella in my car's trunk because you never know. Other than that, I often can't really prepare much.

Q: Do seasons make a difference with what you wear? A: In winter and in summer it is quite obvious what to wear. In spring and autumn you sometimes want to wear a coat and sometimes not. It is quite annoying if you have your coat on on a day with 23° or if you don't on a day with 13°.

Q: Would an app giving a worst-case summary of the weather at all the places you will be at during the day be helpful for these times? A: Definitely for the days where I move between cities. Currently, I would check the weather for both places seperately. It would be cool if I could just get a summary for both places for the times I am at each of them.


__Interview 2__

It changes a lot depending on tenure, office, industry you specialize in and of course how much you are willing to travel.

From BA to EM, you should expect working in a city other than your office roughly half of the year. Every Monday you leave, every Thursday or Friday (depending on whether “Friday in the office” is commonplace where you get hired) you go back. Obviously there will be consultants work the whole year in a different place, while other consultants may work in their home office the whole time.

As you become more senior (AP, Partner, Director), you should expect more frequent, shorter trips. You may spend Monday in a city, Tuesday to Wednesday in another, then maybe get to stay in your home office Thursday and Friday. Then maybe next week you never travel.

Again, it depends on what industry you work on and what client base you build. I’ve seen directors who were able to never travel (except company events), as all their clients were in their hometowns and, even if they were multinational companies, more junior people would travel to the subsidiaries, while the directors themselves would stay in their hometown where the headquarters were.

EDIT: saw the additional questions about enjoying the places you visit. You do, but kind of in a different way than a tourist would. You don’t have time to spend the day sightseeing (unless you stay for the weekend), but you see places a tourist would not see. Restaurants where clients take you to dinner, family meals if you’re lucky enough, you get to work with locals and see how they think, what work looks like there, etc…

Also, in some offices, the policy allows to fly anywhere for the weekend instead of flying home (as long as the ticket is cheaper - but if you book early enough, pretty much everywhere is cheaper than a flexible corporate airfare for even a short flight), which means you can not only explore the country you visit, but also the neighboring ones.
