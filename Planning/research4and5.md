Our main methods of gathering data will be talking to examples of our primary stakeholder (so professionals who have to travel to meetings during their work day) and people who know how these people work - we have members of our group with this knowledge, and can also contact some people that we know. We will also do secondary research online, looking for articles about business travel, as well as finding out if it's likely that our app is likely to actually be used.

* __Secondary research__: Our data gathering revealed that considering what to wear is a "very real concern" for people travelling for business, and that this decision is based on the weather [^1]. Typical real estate agents arrange most of their appointments for the afternoon, but would usually have to travel to their office in the morning and may also go out at lunch time, without being able to go home in between [^5] [^6]. This means that our app would be helping to solve a real problem.
A study [^7] by Harvard Business School also found there is "a lot of travel and a lot of flights", including someone who took 105 flights in a year.
As the typical business professionals use a smartphone (for example, 94% of real estate agents use a smartphone daily [^2]), the app could be accessed and used by a large portion of our primary stakeholder.
Continuing to focus on salespeople (e.g. real estate agents and bankers), we found that the typical real estate agent is 54 and female [^3], while more than 3/4 of entry-level Wall Street bankers are male [^4]. This means that the app could have a wide audience for both men and women.

* __Primary research__: We interviewed a sales and marketing person, who works for a company based in Vienna, asking how their work day is structured and whether the weather app, along with the specific features we've considered, would benefit them. Their answers agreed mostly with the secondary research - their day begins in the office with emails and phone calls, and then, depending on the day, they may go out to meet potential sponsors and exhibitors. They also said that they often move around the city a lot, and sometimes drive to other neighbouring countries. They also said that they do think about the weather when they're travelling, but beyond carrying an umbrella, they can't prepare much, especially in autumn and spring, when the weather is not so predictable and consistent accross one day as it in summer or winter. They said that it would be "cool" to be able to see a summary of the weather for two places together on the days that they move between cities. Another interview told us that people with more junior positions tend to travel to a city and stay there for a few days before returning, while more senior positions take frequent but shorter trips. They also said that if they have a free weekend in the middle of a trip, some offices will pay for them to use that time to visit another city rather than flying home.

4. Choose appropriate techniques to gather data about your stakeholders:
• Which data gathering technique(s) did you choose to use? Why? (max 100 words)
Hint: consider the requirements development process in (6) below when forming your data
gathering questions.
5. Describe the results of your data gathering and provide visualisation of the analyses (max 500 words,
figures do not count towards the limit).
• What did you find from quantitative data analysis?
• What did you find from qualitative data analysis?
• Any unexpected / surprising results?
Support your findings with evidence.
If you used interviews or questionnaires, include the questions as appendices. If you gathered
data from articles, journals, papers etc. make sure you cite these. 


__Data gathering:__
Talking to someone who knows how sales people work - travelling, changing outifts
Researching online - research about whether this is a problem

*Business travel. It’s a great way to build your career but can be a real challenge when it comes to packing. If you’re going someplace you’ve never gone before for business travel, the first question that pops in your head is, “What in the world am I going to wear?”
This is a very real concern.*
