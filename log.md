### The first session 
The first idea we had was to make an app for toddlers (Eric's idea). That was dissmissed because we thought it was too difficult to evaluate target group. Then next idea was to make an app to recommend what to wear according to the weather. We decided that professionals are effected by the weather in their outfit selection, but only need the raw weather to decide what to wear - no direct recommendations. We narrowed the stakeholders down to buisness people who travel (meeting with clients).

### Between sessions
Agni and Eric interviewed potential users, Elanor gathered data, Paulina analyzed cities to draw graphs for our analysis, and Ben researched feasibility of various features and found a suitable weather API.

### The second session 
We started compiling the document and authored sections 6 and 7 based on our research. We also defined a questionaire and deployed it on Reddit.

### Between sessions
Finish compiling the document with multiple feedback cycles and refining our conclusions based on the data obtained from the questionaire.
